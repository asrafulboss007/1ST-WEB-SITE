        “I’m a web developer who turns ideas into smooth, intuitive websites. I love crafting frontend experiences with HTML, CSS, and React—and don’t mind diving into backend code with Node.js. When I’m not coding, I’m experimenting with UI animations or exploring the latest web tools. Let’s build something that not only works—but inspires.”
